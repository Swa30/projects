    "10. What do you understand by the term Normal Distribution?\n",
    "Ans. A normal distribution is a continuous distribution described by a bell shaped symmetric curve.It is a unimodal distribution\n",
    "and, by symmetry of the distribution, mean = median = mode. The tails of the distribution extend to infinity in both the \n",
    "direction, getting closer and closer but never quite touching. The distribution has two parameters mean and standard deviation.\n",

    "Ans. \n",
    "12. What is A/B testing?\n",
    "Ans. A/B testing is basically statistical hypothesis testing, or, statistical inference. \n",
    "It is an analytical method for making decisions that estimates population parameters based on sample statistics.\n",
    "13. Is mean imputation of missing data acceptable practice?\n",
    "Ans. No, its bad practice in general.If just estimating means: mean imputation preserves the mean of the observed data and\n",
    "leads to an underestimate of the standard deviation.Distorts relationships between variables by ‚Äúpulling‚Äù estimates \n",
    "of the correlation toward zero.So if the data are missing completely at random, the estimate of the mean remains unbiased.\n",
    "14. What is linear regression in statistics?\n",
    "Ans. Simple linear regression considers a single regressor or predictor or explanatory variable (X) and a single dependent or \n",
    "response variable (Y). To find the likely form of the relationship, the researcher draws a sample from the population of\n",
    "interest and using the resulting data computes correlation coefficient and plots the scatter diagram.\n",
    "In case, linear relationship is indicated, a simple linear regression model for the population is formed resulting linear\n",
    "equation obtained by substituting the estimated values in place of parameters.\n",
